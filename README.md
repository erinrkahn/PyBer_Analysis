# PyBer Analysis

## Background

### Purpose

The purpose of this new analysis on PyBer data is to compare ride-sharing data by city type; Urban, Suburban and Rural. City and ride data were merged and analyzed across city types for total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and avergage fare per driver. Additionally, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type is utilized to summarize how the data differs by city type and provide recommendations to the decision-makers at PyBer.

The average fare per ride in Suburban cities is $6.44 more than in urban cities and $3.65 less than rural cities. These differences do not account for the average distance per ride in each city type. 

__Average Fare per Driver__
- The average fares per driver per city type are $55.49 (Rural), $39.50 (Suburban) $16.57 (Urban). Drivers in rural towns have an average fare $38.92 higher than in urban cities and $15.99 than in suburban cities.
