# PyBer Analysis

## Background

### Purpose

The purpose of this new analysis on PyBer data is to compare ride-sharing data by city type; Urban, Suburban and Rural. City and ride data were merged and analyzed across city types for total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and avergage fare per driver. Additionally, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type is utilized to summarize how the data differs by city type and provide recommendations to the decision-makers at PyBer. 

## Results

### Summary of Findings

###### PyBer Summary by City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

__Total Rides__
- The total rides per city type are 125 (Rural), 625 (Suburban) and 1,625 (Urban). With the fewest number of rides, rural cities account for 5.3% of the total rides, while suburban rides are 26.3% of the total and urban rides are 68.4%. Urban rides make up the majority of the total rides. 

__Total Drivers__
- The total drivers per city type are 78 (Rural), 490 (Suburban) and 2,405 (Urban). With the fewest number of drivers, rural cities account for 2.6% of the total drivers, while suburban drivers are 16.5% of the total and urban drivers are 80.9%. There are significantly more drivers present in the urban cities, accounting for 4/5 of all PyBer drivers. 

__Total Fares__
- The total fares per city type are $4,327.93 (Rural), $19,356.33 (Suburban) and $39,854.38 (Urban). With the lowest fare total, rural cities account for 6.8% of the total fares, while suburban fares are 30.5% of the total and urban fares are 62.7%. Suburban and urban rides account for 93% of the total fares. 

__Average Fare per Ride__
- The average fares per ride per city type are $34.62 (Rural), $30.97 (Suburban) and $24.53 (Urban). There is an almost $10.00 difference between the average fare per ride in rural cities compared to urban cities, with rural cities having the highest average fare per ride. The average fare per ride in Suburban cities is $6.44 more than in urban cities and $3.65 less than rural cities. These differences do not account for the average distance per ride in each city type. 

__Average Fare per Driver__
- The average fares per driver per city type are $55.49 (Rural), $39.50 (Suburban) $16.57 (Urban). Drivers in rural towns have an average fare $38.92 higher than in urban cities and $15.99 than in suburban cities. Rural drivers make $20.87 more than the average fare for rural cities, while suburban drivers make $8.53 more than the average fare for suburban cities and urban drivers make $7.96 less than the average fare for urban cities.

### Recommendations

1. It is recommended that the number of rural drivers is increased in rural cities, with rural drivers only making up 2.6% of the total drivers. This will decrease the wait time for PyBer riders and increase the total number of rides that can be completed, increasing the total fares in rural cities, which currently account for only 6.8% of total fares. Additional analyses on ride demand in rural cities is recommended. 
2. Using the "Total Fare by City Type" graph, driver count should be increased when increased fare total are observed. For example, in late February there was an increase in total fares across all city types. With this increase in demand, more drivers will allow for more trip to be completed. 
3. Further analyses should be completed to analyze the driver count in urban cities. While urban cities consistently have the highest fare total across weeks, urban drivers make up 80.9% of total drivers, but only 62.7% of total fares. Additionally, this results in urban drivers making $7.96 less than the average fare in urban cities.
